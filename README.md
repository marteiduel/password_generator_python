# Password Generator (Python)
password generator python

This is a practice project to work on my Python skills. For this project, I used the flask and random libraries. As well as some HTML for better "presentation" to the user. 

This password generator will create a random password using upper letters, lower letters, numbers, and symbols. 
If no input is selected from the user it will give a default password of 16 characters.
